📱 Responsive Design & Mobile Navigation
This project is fully responsive across all screen sizes—from widescreen desktop to 320px mobile. The layout dynamically adjusts to ensure clarity, accessibility, and ease of use.
On screens 768px and below, additional navigation features are introduced to enhance usability:
- 🧭 Mobile-friendly navigation bar with simplified access to key pages
- 🛒 Cart layout restructured for vertical stacking and proportional image scaling
- ✅ Buttons resized and realigned to maintain visual harmony and tap-friendly spacing
- 🌿 Product images and details adapt fluidly to smaller screens without overflow or distortion


These enhancements ensure that users can browse, shop, and interact with the app comfortably on any device.
